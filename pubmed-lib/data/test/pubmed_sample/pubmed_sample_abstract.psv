24451147|Epidemiological \| studies indicate that statins, cholesterol-lowering drugs, prevent aggressive prostate cancer and other types of cancer. Employing essentially non-prostate cell lines, we previously showed that statins rapidly downregulate nuclear levels of phosphorylated Akt via P2X7, a purinergic receptor recently implicated in invasive growth. Here, we present studies on phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)-positive prostatic cells. We document an involvement of EH domain-binding protein 1 (EHBP1), previously associated with aggressive prostate cancer and insulin-stimulated trafficking and cell migration, in P2X7 signaling. We also show that EHBP1 is essential for an anti-invasive effect of atorvastatin. Furthermore, EHBP1 interacted with P-Rex1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor previously implicated in invasive growth. Mevalonate did not prevent this anti-invasive effect of atorvastatin. These data indicate that atorvastatin modulates invasiveness via P2X7, EHBP1 and P-Rex1. Interestingly, the interaction between EHBP1 and P-Rex1 was not induced by extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the endogenous P2X7 ligand, and statins counteracted invasiveness stimulated by extracellular ATP. In support of these experimental data, a population-based genetic analysis showed that a loss of function allele in the P2X7 gene (rs3751143) associated with non-aggressive cancer, and the common allele with aggressive cancer. Our data indicate a novel signaling pathway that inhibits invasiveness and that is druggable. Statins may reduce the risk of aggressive prostate cancer via P2X7 and by counteracting invasive effects of extracellular ATP.
31383287|Major Glioblastoma's hallmarks include proliferation, invasion and heterogeneity. Biological 3D tumor spheroid models can serve as intermediate systems between traditional 2D cell culture and complex in vivo models. Tumor spheroids have been shown to more accurately reproduce the spatial organization and microenvironmental factors of in vivo micro-tumors, such as relevant gradients of nutrients and other molecular agents, while they maintain cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. In vitro 3D assays are useful to monitor these properties. Here, we test the suitability of the well-known T98 G Glioblastoma cell line in such a 3D assay. The doubling time and death rate parameters of T98 G are estimated, as well as their spheroidal growth-expansion curves with and without the presence of basement membrane substrate. The T98 G invasive profile is characterized by collective morphology and proliferation-associated invasion. We show that the T98 G secondary GB cell line exhibits both invasive and proliferative capabilities in 3D and thus, can serve as control cell line for the 3D in vitro study of primary GB cell cultures.
31383387|Pain-related affective and/or cognitive characteristics such as depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and self-efficacy are known to exacerbate pain in people with knee osteoarthritis. However, no studies have investigated whether these psychological factors can interfere with pain relief during conservative treatment. The object of this study was to assess the prediction models considering psychological factors to predict pain relief in people with knee osteoarthritis receiving conservative treatment. Study design was a multicenter, and prospective cohort study. Data were collected in the department of physical therapy in 1 hospital and 7 orthopedic clinics. Eighty-eight people with knee osteoarthritis participated in this study and were followed for 3 months. The numeric rating scale and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score scale were used to evaluate pain relief. Potential predictors for pain relief were depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, and pain catastrophizing. The classification and regression trees methodology was used to develop the model for predicting the presence of pain relief at 1 and 3 months after the start of observation. The prediction accuracy was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). The model at 1 month after the start of observation included pain intensity at baseline, positive affect, and disease duration. The AUC of this model was 0.793 (95% confidential interval, 0.687-0.898). The model at 3 months after the start of observation included pain catastrophizing and self-efficacy. The AUC of this model was 0.808 (95% confidential interval, 0.682-0.934). The accuracy of prediction model considering pain-related affective and/or cognitive characteristics is moderate for pain relief in people with knee osteoarthritis receiving conservative treatment.
31687927|Asthma is a dynamic disease, in which lung mechanical and inflammatory processes interact in a complex manner, often resulting in exaggerated physiological, in particular, inflammatory responses to exogenous triggers. We hypothesize that this may be explained by respiratory disease-related systems instability and loss of adaptability to changing environmental conditions, manifested in highly fluctuating biomarkers and symptoms. Using time series of inflammatory (eosinophils, neutrophils, FeNO), clinical and lung function biomarkers (PEF, FVC,FEV), we estimated this loss of adaptive capacity (AC) during an experimental rhinovirus infection in 24 healthy and asthmatic human volunteers. Loss of AC was estimated by comparing similarities between pre- and post-challenge time series. Unlike healthy participants, the asthmatic's post-viral-challenge state resembled more other rhinovirus-infected asthmatics than their own pre-viral-challenge state (hypergeometric-test: p=0.029). This reveals loss of AC and supports the concept that in asthma, biological processes underlying inflammatory and physiological responses are unstable, contributing to loss of control.
